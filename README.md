# NumberWizardConsole
## Learning Game Development Project 1

NumberWizardConsole is a Game developed to play in the Unity console.

The game asks the user to pick a number and then tries to guess it based on the user input.

If the number is Higher then the current guess the user has to press the " Up Arrow Key ".

If the number is Lower then the current guess the user has to press the " Down Arrow Key ".

If the number is the current guess then the user has to press the " Return/Enter Key ".

After the correct guess the Game restarts.

This project was developed for the better understanding of the Basics of Unity Engine and Basics of C#, If statements and functions. 

This project was developed as a part of the Udemy course "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D" under the guidance of Rick Davidson and Ben Tristem.
